<p>
	Service Projects are performed at least five times throughout the year. Most commonly this is done through supporting Scouts as they complete their Eagle Scout projects. Once a year, a service project is also performed to benefit the chartered organization.
<br> <br> 
	As volunteer efforts are announced, these events will be posted here.  
<br> <br> 
	Below is a list of past service and volunteer events Troop 22 has participated in.
</p>

<p>	Michael Nuata eagle project: Barn raising for Mapleton City Park
</p>

<p>	This is Nolan. My eagle project is this Saturday at 8:00 AM in Diamond fork canyon. We will be replacing signs and sanding and staining benches 
	at a nature trail. Can I get an RSVP by this Tuesday evening to plan car pools and parking? Also, please, let me know if you are willing to drive 
	and how many extra people you could take. Thanks!
</p>
<p>	This is Nathan Porter. This upcoming Saturday morning I will be doing my Eagle project up Payson canyon at the grotto trail. We will be helping 
	build a trail and and be putting in trial head signs. I would appreciate help from anyone that could come. Bring sturdy shoes and work gloves. 
	If you would like to come up and help and wonâ€™t be at campout I will send out an exact start time later this week.
