<p> 
	Troop 22 was chartered in December 2019 and has been serving scouts ages 11-18 in Mapleton, UT area.  We are a part of the Silver Sage District in the Crossroads of the West 
	Council and are sponsored by Trace Lund, DDS.  
</p> 
<p> 
	Troop meetings are held on the second and fourth Thursday evenings at 7:00pm MT.  
</p> 
<p> 
	Our goal is to promote Scouts BSA vision to prepare every eligible youth in America to become a responsible, participating citizen and leader who is guided by the Scout Oath 
	and Law.  We also support the mission to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.  
</p> 
<p> 
	Our leaders are properly trained in the Scouts BSA method, in youth protection training, safety and first aid so our scouts can be mentored in a safe and productive 
	environment.  Our leaders attend our meetings and events both on the local and district level.  Our troop is for scouts led by scouts and the leaders are there to foster a 
	positive environment.  
</p> 
<p> 
	We welcome new scouts at all times and invite you to contact one of our leaders to find out more information.
</p> 

	

<p>		
	Troop 22 has helped 28 young men reach their Eagle Scout Award since 2019.
